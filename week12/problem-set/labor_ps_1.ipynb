He can enjoy the remaining part of the day, such that his leisure time is given by $l_t = 24 - h_t$, where $h_t$ denotes his choice of hours of work.\n",

    "On Day 1 Robinson is completely unskilled and no matter how many hours he works, he gets 1 unit of produce. Working more  than 8 hours a day allows Robinson to learn how to take better care of the crops, such that he is able to produce more. In particular, for every additional 4 hours of work on either day Robinson levels up his farming skills by 1 unit. E.g., if Robinson works for 16 hours on Day 1, his skills/experience on Day 2 will be 2; if Robinson then also works 12 hours on Day 2, his skills/experience on Day 3 would be 3.
