    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where only market level data on product demand are available: market shares, prices, product characteristics. We wish to estimate consumer preferences, compute the resulting price elasticities, and ultimately learn the firms' implied profit margins and marginal cost. To do so, we make use of a model of individual utility maximization and imperfect competition on the product market. Note, that the crucial assumption in Berry (1994) and virtually all subsequent work is that market shares are generated by a large number (technically, infinity) of consumers in the market and, hence, can be used as a measure of individual choice probabilities.\n",

The utility of the outside good is normalized such that $\\delta_{0t}=0$.

If marginal cost are known, we obtain the supply side by solving the system for $c_t$:\n",
